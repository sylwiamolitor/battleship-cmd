### Detailed specification in refman.pdf. 
Battleship is a classic naval strategy game where players take turns guessing the locations of each other's ships on a grid. Each player has a fleet of ships placed secretly on their board, and the objective is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours. Players call out coordinates to attack, and the game continues until one player has successfully destroyed all of the other's ships.
